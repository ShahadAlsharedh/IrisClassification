# Iris Classification Using Deep LearningÂ ðŸª»

This assignment focused on using deep learning to classify the iris dataset. In the notebook, I focused on EDA to understand the features and their relationships. I used a simple neural network implemented with TensorFlow/Keras to achieve high accuracy in classifying the dataset.

# Overview ðŸ”Ž

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, containing 150 samples of iris flowers with the following features:

- Sepal Length

- Sepal Width

- Petal Length

- Petal Width

The goal is to classify the flowers into one of three species based on these features.

# Key Features ðŸ”‘

1. Analyse the dataset. 

2. Build a fully connected feedforward neural network.

3. Visualizing training performance with accuracy and loss curves.

4. Evaluating the model on test data.

# Requirment ðŸ’»

- Python

- TensorFlow/Keras

- NumPy

- Matplotlib

- Scikit-learn

# Acknowledgments âœ¨

I'd like to thank Dr. Mustafa Youldas for his valuable expertise and persistent support.
